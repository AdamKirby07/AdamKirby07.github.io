<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly Design</strong>: Alligator-clip terminals make connections easy.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery Connector Included</strong>: Power the BiscuitMCU easily with the included battery connector. The board supports 7 to 12 volts DC (non-lithium) batteries, such as AA, AAA, or 9-volt batteries. This ensures safety for beginners, as lithium-based products are not used. <em>Note: This board does not charge the batteries.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Programming</strong>: The built-in bootloader allows the BiscuitMCU to appear as a USB storage drive (U2F drive). Simply drag and drop your compiled code to program it.</li>
    <li><strong>Arduino IDE Support</strong>: BiscuitMCU works seamlessly with the Arduino IDE, making programming straightforward and intuitive. (Library details will be provided soon.)</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Programming</strong>: For more experienced users, the BiscuitMCU supports uploading compiled hex files directly from the MPLAB IDE—a great way to learn commercial microcontroller programming.</li>
    <li><strong>USB-IF Compliant</strong>: The BiscuitMCU complies with USB-IF standards, drawing a maximum of 450mA of current, which is plenty for a wide range of projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Built-In Safety Features</strong>: Includes an auto-resettable fuse that protects against overcurrent, resetting within 24 hours for uninterrupted use.</li>
    <li><strong>Expansion and Future Upgrades</strong>: The upcoming <em>Add on board</em> will add even more beginner-friendly functionality to the BiscuitMCU with a simple bolt-on design. This feature is currently in testing and will be released soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Using Arduino IDE</strong>: BiscuitMCU supports programming via the popular Arduino IDE. Details about the BiscuitMCU Arduino library will be shared soon.</li>
    <li><strong>Using MPLAB IDE</strong>: For advanced users, program the BiscuitMCU by uploading compiled hex files from the MPLAB IDE.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Certifications</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OSHWA Certification</strong>: BiscuitMCU has applied for Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) certification. (<em>Details will be updated here when the certification is approved.</em>)</li>
    <li><strong>UKCA Certification</strong>: BiscuitMCU has completed full UK conformity assessment (UKCA) testing. Products for sale meet this high standard, ensuring exceptional safety and reliability for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Certifications, such as OSHWA and UKCA, may become invalid or subject to change if the product is modified, or if you produce it yourself.</p>
